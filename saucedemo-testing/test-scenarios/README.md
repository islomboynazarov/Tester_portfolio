# Test Scenarios

## Purpose
This folder contains high-level test scenarios that define **what needs to be tested** in the application.

Test scenarios are derived from the Test Plan and are used as an intermediate layer between the Test Plan and detailed Test Cases.

---

## Writing Rules
- Scenarios are written as single-sentence statements
- No test steps
- No test data
- No expected results
- One clear testing intent per scenario

---

## Organization
Scenarios are grouped by application feature (e.g., Login, Products, Cart, Checkout) and stored in separate files for clarity and traceability.

---

## Usage
Each test scenario serves as a basis for creating one or more detailed test cases in the **Test Cases** folder.
