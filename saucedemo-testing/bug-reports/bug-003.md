**Test Execution Report**

**Project Information**

Application Name: Sauce Demo

Application Type: Web-based e-commerce application

Test Type: Manual Functional Testing

Tested URL: https://www.saucedemo.com/

**Test Cycle:** Cycle 1

**Objective**

The objective of this test execution was to validate the core functional behavior of the Sauce Demo application based on the approved Test Plan, Test Scenarios, and Test Cases.

The execution focused on verifying critical user flows such as login, product listing, sorting, cart operations, and checkout.

**Test Environment**

Browser: Brave 1.86.139

Operating System: Windows 10

**Test Data:** Predefined demo credentials

**Testing Method:** Manual execution

**Scope of Execution**

The following functional areas were executed:

Login functionality

Product listing and visibility

Product sorting

Shopping cart operations

Checkout process

Out-of-scope items (performance, security, API, automation) were not executed as defined in the Test Plan.

**Test Execution Summary**

| Module    | Total Test Cases | Passed | Failed |
| --------- | ---------------- | ------ | ------ |
| Login     | 8                | 7      | 1      |
| Products  | 6                | 5      | 1      |
| Sorting   | 6                | 4      | 2      |
| Cart      | 6                | 6      | 0      |
| Checkout  | 8                | 7      | 1      |
| **Total** | **34**           | **29** | **5**  |

**Execution Status**

Passed: Test cases executed successfully with expected behavior

Failed: Test cases failed due to identified application defects

Failed test cases have corresponding bug reports documented separately in the Bug Reports folder.

**Defect Summary**

| Bug ID        | Module   | Severity | Status |
| ------------- | -------- | -------- | ------ |
| BUG_LOGIN_001 | Login    | Medium   | Open   |
| BUG_SORT_001  | Sorting  | Medium   | Open   |
| BUG_SORT_002  | Sorting  | Medium   | Open   |
| BUG_CHECK_001 | Checkout | Medium   | Open   |
| BUG_PROD_001  | Products | Low      | Open   |

**Key Observations**

Core application functionality is generally stable

Sorting functionality shows inconsistent behavior

Minor validation issues observed during login and checkout

No critical defects blocking basic application usage

**Risks and Limitations**

Testing was limited to a single browser and OS

Non-functional testing was excluded

Automation coverage was not part of this execution cycle

**Conclusion**

The test execution validated the majority of core functional requirements of the Sauce Demo application. While most features performed as expected, several medium-severity defects were identified, primarily related to sorting behavior and input validation.

The application is usable, but defect fixes are recommended before considering release readiness.
